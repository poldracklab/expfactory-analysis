"""
The results.data object has one row per worker/experiment pair. 

The column "data" holds the data as a dictionary. Unofrunately, this
data is in a 1-length list, and the data's "trialdata" is really what you want.

To index the first row's data you would index the results.data object like so:
>>> first_row_data = results.data.iloc[0]['data'][0]['trialdata']

Which can then be converted into a dataframe easily
>>> first_row_data = pandas.DataFrame(first_row_data)
